# Bubble Sort In Assembly

All of the logisim circuits that were created were done by my partner, Chris Keiningham, and myself.

The bubble sort RSC assembly program was created by myself. 

The compiler used for this programs can be found here: https://github.com/Calastrophe/pythonRSC

To run the RSC:
    
    1. Please download logisim. It can be downloaded here: https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution#download

    2. Clone this repository then open RSC.circ in logisim. 

    3. Double Click on the RSC circuit. 

    4. Right click on the RAM module (top right of the bus loop) and click Load Image. 

    5. Find and select the bubble_sort_assemble file and click Open

    6. Click on Simulate in the top right

    7. Set the Auto-Tick Frequency to a high value 

    8. Under the same tab, click on Auto-Click Enabled

    At this point, the clock should be ticking and you should see output on the Hex Digit Displays. 
    The first set of outputs represent what the list looks like before it is sorted. When the program finishes, the values should be sorted in ascending order.

To recompile the file or to create your own program, please refer to pythonRSC (https://github.com/Calastrophe/pythonRSC).

A special thank you to Dr. Arpan Sainju, our professor at MTSU for making the project possible.
